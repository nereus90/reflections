When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you need to work from multiple locations or if multiple people are working on the same project from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you were working on your own version of a project you might not want to include every change to the original repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of a project to your github account, clones are copies of a project to a local directory, branches are 
a seperate path of commits for a project, distinct from other branches.
